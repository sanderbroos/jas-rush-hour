# jas-rush-hour


### Description:
Rush hour is a sliding block game in which you need to free the red car, or in our case the car named 'X'. To free this car you need to unblock the route to the exit, by arranging the cars in a way that the cars blocking the path to the exit can be moved. Our goal is to find an algorithm which can find the most efficient way to move the cars, to solve this puzzle.

### Usage:
To run an algorithm, first select the desired algorithm and then input the following:
```
python main.py
```
